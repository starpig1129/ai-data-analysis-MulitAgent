```

## Usage

### Using Python Script

You can run the system  using main.py:

1. Place your data file (e.g., YourDataName.csv) in the data directory

2. Modify the user_input variable in the main() function of main.py:
```python
user_input = '''
datapath:YourDataName.csv
Use machine learning to perform data analysis and write complete graphical reports
'''
```

ˇ. Run the script:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Main Components

- `hypothesis_agent`: Generates research hypotheses
- `process_agent`: Supervises the entire research process
- `visualization_agent`: Creates data visualizations
- `code_agent`: Writes data analysis code
- `searcher_agent`: Conducts literature and web searches
- `report_agent`: Writes research reports
- `quality_review_agent`: Performs quality reviews
- `note_agent`: Records the research process

## Workflow

The system uses LangGraph to create a state graph that manages the entire research process. The workflow includes the following steps:

1. Hypothesis generation
2. Human choice (continue or regenerate hypothesis)
3. Processing (including data analysis, visualization, search, and report writing)
4. Quality review
5. Revision as needed

### Agent Model Configuration

Users can customize each agent's language model provider and model configuration by editing the `agent_models.yaml` file (located in your `CONFIG_DIRECTORY`). This allows for seamless environment switching (dev/prod) by simply pointing to a different configuration folder.

Here's an example structure of `agent_models.yaml`:

```yaml
agents:
  hypothesis_agent:
    provider: openai
    model_config:
      model: gpt-5-nano
      temperature: 1.0
  note_agent:
    provider: google
    model_config:
      model: gemini-2.5-pro
      temperature: 1.0
  code_agent:
    provider: anthropic
    model_config:
      model: claude-haiku-4-5
      temperature: 1.0
```

- **provider**: Specifies the language model provider to use (e.g., openai, google, anthropic, ollama, groq, atlascloud)
- **model_config**: Contains model-specific configuration parameters
  - `model`: The specific model name to use
  - `temperature`: Controls the randomness of model output (range: 0.0-2.0)

## Advanced Configuration System

DATAGEN implements a powerful **Progressive Disclosure** architecture for agent configuration, inspired by [Claude Agent Skills](https://platform.claude.com/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview).

### Key Features
- **Unified Config Root**: All core settings are managed via the `CONFIG_DIRECTORY` environment variable.
- **Skill-Based Architecture**: Reusable skills stored in `skills/` (within the config root)
- **Dynamic Tool Loading**: Tools configured via `config.yaml` using `ToolFactory`
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: External server integration (Filesystem, GitHub, Web Search)
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Three-level loading strategy for Context Window optimization

## Notes

- Ensure you have sufficient API credits, as the system will make multiple API calls.
- The system may take some time to complete the entire research process, depending on the complexity of the task.
- **WARNING**: The agent system may modify the data being analyzed. It is highly recommended to backup your data before using this system.
- DATAGEN does not ship or train on project-provided training datasets. Users provide their own analysis data at runtime through `WORKING_DIRECTORY`.

## Current Issues and Solutions
1. NoteTaker Efficiency Improvement
2. Overall Runtime Optimization

## Other Projects
Here are some of my other notable projects:

### PheroPath
PheroPath is a filesystem-based stigmergy communication protocol that allows agents and humans to leave invisible "pheromones" (signals) on files. It enables communicating context, risks (DANGER), or status (TODO, SAFE) without modifying the file content itself, facilitating better multi-agent collaboration.
