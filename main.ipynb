      "     1. Perform an ANOVA test to compare the means of total revenue across different product categories.\n",

      "     3. Visualize the results using box plots.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Hypothesis 2: Payment Method Impact on Units Sold**\n",
      "   - **Statement**: The payment method used by customers affects the number of units sold.\n",
      "   - **Steps to Test**:\n",
      "     1. Conduct a Chi-square test of independence to assess the relationship between payment method and units sold.\n",
      "     2. Create a contingency table to visualize the distribution of units sold across different payment methods.\n",

      "\n",
      "3. **Hypothesis 3: Seasonal Trends in Sales**\n",
      "   - **Statement**: There are seasonal trends in sales, with certain months showing higher total revenue than others.\n",
      "   - **Steps to Test**:\n",
      "     1. Decompose the time series data of total revenue by month to identify trends and seasonality.\n",
      "     2. Use time series analysis (e.g., ARIMA) to model and forecast future sales.\n",
      "     3. Visualize the time series data with seasonal decomposition plots.\n",

      "4. **Hypothesis 4: Price Sensitivity of Units Sold**\n",
      "   - **Statement**: There is a negative correlation between unit price and units sold, indicating price sensitivity among consumers.\n",
      "   - **Steps to Test**:\n",
      "     1. Calculate the correlation coefficient between unit price and units sold.\n",
