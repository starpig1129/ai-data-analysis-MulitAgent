Here are the hypotheses along with the steps to test them:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Research Hypotheses\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Hypothesis 1: The product category significantly affects total revenue.**\n",
      "   - **Null Hypothesis (H0):** There is no significant difference in total revenue across different product categories.\n",
      "   - **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** There is a significant difference in total revenue across different product categories.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Hypothesis 2: The payment method influences the average units sold.**\n",
      "   - **Null Hypothesis (H0):** The payment method does not influence the average units sold.\n",
      "   - **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** The payment method influences the average units sold.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Hypothesis 3: There is a correlation between unit price and total revenue.**\n",
      "   - **Null Hypothesis (H0):** There is no correlation between unit price and total revenue.\n",
      "   - **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** There is a positive correlation between unit price and total revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Steps to Test the Hypotheses\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Data Preprocessing:**\n",
      "   - Clean the dataset by handling missing values and ensuring data types are correct.\n",
      "   - Convert the 'Date' column to a datetime format for time series analysis if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Statistical Analysis:**\n",
      "   - For Hypothesis 1, perform an ANOVA test to compare total revenue across different product categories.\n",
      "   - For Hypothesis 2, use a t-test or ANOVA to analyze the average units sold based on payment methods.\n",
      "   - For Hypothesis 3, calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between unit price and total revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Model Building:**\n",
      "   - Use regression analysis to model the relationship between unit price and total revenue.\n",
      "   - Implement machine learning models (e.g., decision trees, random forests) to predict total revenue based on product category and payment method.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Model Evaluation:**\n",
      "   - Evaluate the statistical significance of the results from the tests.\n",
      "   - Use metrics such as R-squared for regression models and accuracy for classification models.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Visualization:**\n",
      "   - Create visualizations (e.g., box plots, scatter plots) to illustrate the findings and support the hypotheses.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Feasibility and Uniqueness\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Feasibility:** The hypotheses are feasible as they can be tested using standard statistical methods and machine learning techniques. The dataset contains sufficient observations (240 rows) to perform meaningful analyses.\n",
      "- **Uniqueness:** These hypotheses explore relationships that are commonly investigated in e-commerce analytics, but the specific focus on payment methods and product categories in relation to revenue and sales provides a unique angle for analysis.\n",
